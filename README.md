# SadLibs

SadLibs is a Mad Libs-style activity that allows you to generate your own monologue in the style of the over-emotional characters of NBC's hit series, "This is Us."

That show was something of a guilty pleasure for me, so after it ended in May 2022, I felt compelled to make something to commemorate it.

This was built with React. It's not stunningly complicated, but I'm kind of proud of the fact that I started and finished it over a weekend.
